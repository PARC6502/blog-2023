A new blog I'm building. At the time of writing it's still not live.

In addition to being a platform for my medium to longer-form writing (and potentially some creative coding sketches), I wanted to use this blog as a chance to play around with some technologies/frameworks I've not used much:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Astro](https://astro.build/)

In addition, I may end up using a new component framework, like Svelte or Solid, but I'll see how it goes once I get started.
